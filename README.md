Requirements For Windows
1. You need to have python installed. It doesn’t have to be the latest version as there are several. The one I’ve used is Python 3.8. Here is a helpful link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Also you need to have Anaconda which is similar to python but it is a package. Here is a helpful link:  https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ From that package there will be multiple items to launch, we will launch something called Spyder (which also has several versions). I have Spyder4. This is like a notepad but is inbuilt with python variables and commands.

3. Go to https://www.dk.com/uk/information/computer-coding/ and download a zip folder “Python Games Resource Pack”. If you don’t have this “Computer coding python games book” Then download it from https://www.google.co.uk/  or from https://www.pdfdrive.com/. 

4. Open “File Explorer” and go into “Desktop”. Where it says “This PC” and ”Desktop” in the right hand top corner type cmd. Then a black screen with your PC’s version and details. CMD is a command prompt.

5. After that type pip install pygame to install Pygame. Once it has downloaded you need to install Pgzero so in the command prompt type the following pip install pgzero. Then your good to go.

6. When you test any of the scripts or want to play the game you have to go in your Games Folder that you have made and go in the game you want to play or test, then at the top right corner “C:\Users\abdul\Desktop\Python-games”, within the file type CMD (the command prompt) and type pgzrun in the command prompt this is a command which will run your code. If there are any errors they will come up. Command Prompt will indicate which line it is in and will show what you wrote. 

7. Now, before you begin coding, you have a choice: to use python IDLE from Python, or Spyder. I prefer Spyder.
